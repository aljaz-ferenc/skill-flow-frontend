### How It Works

1. **Create a Roadmap**  
   The user inputs a topic they want to learn. The `roadmap_generator_agent` generates an initial roadmap, which is then evaluated by `roadmap_reviewer_agent`. This agent provides feedback to improve the roadmap’s structure, ensuring sections are well-distributed, concepts are fully covered, and there’s no overlap.

2. **Plan Lessons**  
   The `lesson_planner_agent` generates a list of lessons and their learning objectives based on the roadmap and concepts covered. This context ensures lessons are well-planned, non-overlapping, and fully encapsulate each concept.

3. **Generate Lesson**  
   When a user clicks on an unlocked lesson, the `lesson_generator_agent` creates the lesson on-demand. Using the roadmap, concept, and lesson objectives as context, it generates reading material with examples. Each lesson includes a few questions that must be completed in a quiz before unlocking the next lesson.

4. **Quiz**  
   Quizzes are comprised of questions generated by `lesson_generator_agent`. There are two types of questions:
    - **Multiple-choice**: The user selects the correct answer from given options.
    - **Open-ended**: The user answers in their own words. The AI agent evaluates the answer and provides feedback to further explain the topic.
